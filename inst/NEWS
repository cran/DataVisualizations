Version 1.1.11 (CRAN, 2020-02-13)
- Bugfix: Missing rgl packages in solaris combined with a CRAN check of Plot3D does not allow the package to install itself
- CombineCols: Robust alternative to \code{\link{cbind}} that fills missing values with nan instead of extending length of vector by duplicating elements

Version 1.1.10 (CRAN, 2020-02-02)
- DualaxisLinechart works now in combination with plotly::subplot ommitting the bug of subplot, see https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/issues/954
- MDplot has now two new sorting options for columns: increasing average or variance, or decreasing bimodality (using packages modes).
- Bugfix: MDplot bug fixed in case of two columns of which one is only NaN and in case of jittered not-finite values.
- Bugfix: ParetoDensityEstimationV2 bug for data with only two unique values fixed.
- Bugfix: MDplot4multiplevectors: rowr is depricated, hence the relevant function is internally integrated now in MDplot4multiplevectors
- Naming Convention: delted V2 in ParetoDensityEstimation, ParetoRadius and OptimalNoBins because these functions are now completly removed from the AdaptGauss package.

Version 1.1.9 (CRAN, 2019-11-10)
- Improvements in ClassMDplot in the case of Big Data (e.g. Flow Cytometry data of CLL)
- bugfix ABCbarplot: x-axis shows now correct prozentual values between 1 and 100.
- Pixelmatrix is now significantly fast by using geom_raster instead of geom_tile.
- Bugfix MDplot: Several whitespread unique values in large data vectors are visualized correctly. Option "RobustGaussian=TRUE" now works also if only one column of data is given as input.
- Bugfix ParetoDensityEstimationV2: Assumes now the dirac delta distribution for one ore two unique values in a given vector of data of arbitrary length.
- All density estimation based function are now faster because Rcpp is used for the bottleneck stats function.
- zplot: Changed interpolation from akima to MBA due to licensing issues with akima, see https://www.user2017.brussels/uploads/bivand_gebhardt_user17_a0.pdf
- Bugfix MDplot: Blanks in colnames are caught and replaced by numbers.

Version 1.1.8 (CRAN, 2019-08-20)
- new implementation of Pareto density estimation (PDE), pareto radius and optimal number of bins for histograms.
- AdaptGauss package detached and new PDE attached to MD plot.
- ABCbarplot: Barplot with Sorted Data Colored by ABCanalysis which can be also used as a scree plot.
- Several minor documentatio corrections and bugfixes.

Version 1.1.7 (GitHub, 2019-04-17)
o Bugfix: In MD-plot Jitter Plot for colomuns with one unique value, in the case it is zero, corrected.
o Bugfix: In MD-plot statistical cases for colomuns with one unique value but more than 45000 cases corrected.
o Bugfix: In MD-plot does not crash anymore if columns exists with not one finite values but data has more cases than the sample size.
o Bugfix: Namespace of AdaptGauss package added for Pareto density estimation
o Bugfix: Regression line in QQplot fixed.

Version 1.1.6 (CRAN, 2019-03-08)
	o Major Improvement: The MD-plot samples now data automatically above an threshold in order to be usuable for Big Data.
	o Bugfixes: In MD-plot the testing against uniform distribution now works also for one feauture. A crash is fixed where a columns has not even one finite value.
	o Bugfix: If colnames of Data are given in MD-plot but not unique, they are renamed to unique colnames.
	o Bugfix: Plot3D checks now that the length of Cls is equal to the number of rows of data.
	o Bugfix: ClassPDEplot did not plot all pdfs for SameKernelsAndRadius=0.
	o Improvement: ClassMDplot now jitters points instead of visualizing pdf if not enough data in class is given.
	o Bugfix: In Heatmap the x labels are now plotted correctly.
	o Bugfix: In ClassMDplot class names now work correctly.
	o Classplot and DualClassplot: Functions allow to plot one or two time series with a classification as scatter plots or line and scatter plots. Usefull to see if temporal clustering has time dependent variations and for Hidden Markov Models (see Mthrun/RHmm on GitHub).
	
Version 1.1.5 (CRAN, 2019-02-02)
	o Bugfix: The statistical testing in the MD-plot now is omitted if not enough unique values are given in some features. In such a case, only a scatter plot is plotted.
	o Naming Convention: Standardized plotting functions by removing "plot" in names except cases where it is conventional in other sources, e.g. MAplot. Older function names will be removed in the next CRAN version.
						o  plotWorldmap renamed to Worldmap
						o  plotChoroplethMap renamed to Choroplethmap
						o  ClassBoxPlot renamed to ClassBoxplot
						o  fanPlot renamed to Fanplot
						o  pieChart renamed to Piechart
						o  CrossTablePlot renamed to Crosstable
						o  slopeChart renamed to Slopechart
						o  plot3D renamed to Plot3D
						o  InspectScatterOfData renamed to InspectScatterplots
						o  PixelMatrixPlot renamed to Pixelmatrix
						o  ShepardScatterPlot renamed to Sheparddiagram
						o  ShepardDensityPlot renamed to ShepardPDEscatter
						o  DualAxisLineChart renamed to DualaxisLinechart
						o  SilhouettePlot renamed to Silhouetteplot
						o  BoxplotData renamed to InspectBoxplots
						o  QQplotWithFit renamed to QQplot
	o nanPlot is deprecated. The new function is PlotMissingvalues.
	o ClassViolinPlot is deprecated. The new function is ClassMDplot.

Version 1.1.4 (GitHub, 2018-11-17)
	o SignedLog: Allows to transform negativ values with logarithm.

Version 1.1.4 (CRAN, 2018-10-21)
	o DualAxisLineChart enables to visualize to lines in one plot overlaying them using ploty (e.g. two time series with two ranges of values)
	o Bugfix: PDEscatter now removes non-numeric values with na.rm=TRUE before xlim and ylim are defined
	o ProductRatioPlot: The plot is useful in the case where there are many instances of very small values, but a small number of very large ones
	o CrossTablePlot: Presents a heatmap with values and a cross table of given Data matrix of two features and a bin width or percentualized values
	o Update: plot3D function and documentation improved.
	
Version 1.1.3 (GitHub, 2018-07-07)
	o Improvement: MD-plot layout changes and plotting paramater added.
	o InspectCorrelation now visualizes the density and calcluates the spearman correlation index as a shortcut to PDEscatter.
