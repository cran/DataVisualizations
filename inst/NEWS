Version 1.1.4 (CRAN, 2018-10-21)
	o DualAxisLineChart enables to visualize to lines in one plot overlaying them using ploty (e.g. two time series with two ranges of values)
	o Bugfix: PDEscatter now removes non-numeric values with na.rm=TRUE before xlim and ylim are defined
	o ProductRatioPlot: The plot is useful in the case where there are many instances of very small values, but a small number of very large ones
	o CrossTablePlot: Presents a heatmap with values and a cross table of given Data matrix of two features and a bin width or percentualized values
	o Update: plot3D function and documentation improved.
	
Version 1.1.3 (GitHub, 2018-07-07)
	o Improvement: MD-plot layout changes and plotting paramater added
	o InspectCorrelation now visualizes the density and calcluates the spearman correlation index as a shortcut to PDEscatter
	o Minor bugifx: MD-plot now uses ggExtra::rotateTextX() for better xaxis alignment of text
	
Version 1.1.2 (GitHub, 2018-07-02)
	o Bugfix: InspectDistances methods argument now passed on to parallelDist::parDist

Version 1.1.1 (CRAN 2018-06-30)
	o Improved visualization of MD-plot
	
Version 1.1.0 (GitHub)
    o Vignette generated
	o Bugfix: authors stated in Description regarding functions which were used in other dbt packages instead of this package.
	
Version 1.0.9 (GitHub)
    o ClassViolinPlot build on top of stat_pde_density for Data with Clustering
    o Bugfix in stat_pde_density for special case of one value
	o parallelDist integrated for faster distance computations
	
Version 1.0.8 (GitHub)
    o Bugfix in stat_pde_density for special case of one value
	o Minor bugfix in PDEscatter
	
Version 1.0.7 (GitHub)
    o MD-plot: stat_pde_density added in order to integrate concept with ggplot2

Version 1.0.1-1.0.6 (GitHub)
    o ClassBoxPlot function added for Data with Clustering
	o ClassPDEplot function added for Data with Clustering
	o ClassPDEplotMaxLikeli function added for Data with Clustering
	o Minor bugfix in InspectVariable function
	o Bugfix in internpiechart

Version 1.0.0 (CRAN, 2018-05-06)
    o Complete package generated
